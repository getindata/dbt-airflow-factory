# DBT Airflow Factory

Library to convert DBT manifest metadata to Airflow tasks

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip][pip] to install the library:

```bash
pip install dbt-airflow-factory
```

## Usage

The library is expected to be used inside an Airflow environment with a Kubernetes image referencing **dbt**.

**dbt-airflow-factory**'s main task is to parse `manifest.json` and create Airflow DAG out of it. It also reads config
files from `config` directory and therefore is highly customizable (e.g., user can set path to `manifest.json`).

To start, create a directory with a following structure, where `manifest.json` is a file generated by **dbt**:
```
.
├── config
│   ├── base
│   │   ├── airflow.yml
│   │   ├── dbt.yml
│   │   └── k8s.yml
│   └── dev
│       └── dbt.yml
├── dag.py
└── manifest.json
```

Then, put the following code into `dag.py`:
```python
from dbt_airflow_factory.airflow_dag_factory import AirflowDagFactory
from os import path

dag = AirflowDagFactory(path.dirname(path.abspath(__file__)), "dev").create()
```

When uploaded to Airflow DAGs directory, it will get picked up by Airflow, parse `manifest.json` and prepare a DAG to run.

### Configuration files

It is best to look up the example configuration files in [tests directory][tests] to get a glimpse of correct configs.

You can use [Airflow template variables][airflow-vars] in your `dbt.yml` and `k8s.yml` files, as long as they are inside
quotation marks:
```yaml
target: "{{ var.value.env }}"
some_other_field: "{{ ds_nodash }}"
```

Analogously, you can use `"{{ var.value.VARIABLE_NAME }}"` in `airflow.yml`, but only the Airflow variable getter.
Any other Airflow template variables will not work in `airflow.yml`.

### Creation of the directory with data-pipelines-cli

**DBT Airflow Factory** works best in tandem with [data-pipelines-cli][dp-cli] tool. **dp** not only prepares directory
for the library to digest, but also automates Docker image building and pushes generated directory to the cloud storage
of your choice.
